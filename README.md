## The  program supports the same functionality as the classic [CloneApp for Desktop](https://github.com/mirinsoft/CloneApp) but for Microsoft Store applications, aka Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps.

First thing you need to do is click on the scan link to scan the current system for UWP applications. All UWP apps found are listed in the middle column after the scan. Each application is listed with its name and a checkbox to select it.

You may select one, some or all apps individually, or select all/none with a click on the select item in the left column.

Apps are backed up to the Backup folder in the main program folder; ideal for portable use. A click on restore restores any application that is backed up, an option to restore the settings of individual applications does not seem to exist currently.

CloneApp UA supports also repair functionality next to that. Select one or multiple apps, and then the repair option to display available options.

Repair supports four operations currently:

* Normal Reset
* Hard Reset
* Clear App Cache
* Clear App Store Cache

*A normal reset clears the settings file, a hard reset settings files, app data, preferences, and sign-in details. System apps and installed Microsoft Store apps can be reset.*

## CloneApp UA requires Windows 10, 8.1, 8, including both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
